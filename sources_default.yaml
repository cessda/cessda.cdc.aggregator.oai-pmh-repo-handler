# This is a default source definition file used to construct OAI-Set
# that are based on base url of the originating archive.
# Use this file as an example to build custom source definitions.
# If this file is changed, it leads to all default source definitions
# being changed also.
#
# NOTE that both the url and source values must be unique within
# this YAML document. Otherwise the program will not work correctly.
# The uniqueness is not enforced by the program. In other words, there
# is no validation performed against this file.
